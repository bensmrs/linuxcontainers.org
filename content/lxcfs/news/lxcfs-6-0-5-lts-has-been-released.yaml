  # Introduction
  The LXCFS team is pleased to announce the release of LXCFS 6.0.5!

  This is the fifth bugfix release for LXCFS 6.0 which is supported until June 2029.

  # Changes
  There are no significant changes in this release, only a couple of minor changes to our CI scripts. We are still pushing a LXCFS update out to keep versions in sync between LXC, LXCFS and Incus, but this release is effectively identical to 6.0.4.

  The full list of commits is available below:

  [details="Detailed changelog"]
   - github: Bump actions/checkout to v5
   - github: Use Github Arm runners
  [/details]

  # Support and upgrade
  The LXCFS 6.0 branch is supported until June 2029.
  Only bugfixes and security issues get included into the stable bugfix releases, so it's always safe and recommended to keep up and run the latest bugfix release.
